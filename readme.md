* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Install Node.js from <https://nodejs.org/en/>.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - A package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
